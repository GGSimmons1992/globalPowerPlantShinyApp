# globalPowerPlantShinyApp

Power generation from powerplants have been contested between different administrations in US history. Some groups prefer traditional fossil fuel methods like oil and gas, while some groups prefer more renewable sources like wind and solar. The Global Power Plant Shiny App gives a survey over a country's energy production over a 5 year period between 2013-2017. It also displays a count of each plant per type and gives a map of the global distribution of plants based on a certain type.
